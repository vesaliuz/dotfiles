#### Installation
+ My setup is using the dependencies below, you can change stuff as you wise, if you want more minimal setup you are welcome to use the dependencies.
  - awesome (window manager framework)
  - rofi (application launcher)
  - blueman (bluetooth widgets)
  - xfce4-power-manager (power widget)
  - xbacklight (adjust backlight brightness)
  - pulseaudio, alsa-utils (volume/audio keybinds)
  - mpd, mpc (music widget)
  - xorg-xwininfo, xprop (custom titlebar)
  - xdg-menu (generates app list)
  - jq (Formatting)
  - flameshot (screenshots)
+ Copy the files to `$HOME/.config/awesome/`
+ Reload Awesome using `Super + shift + r`


# File Structure
This setup is split in multiple parts:
+ `rc.lua` the core of configuration. You can enable and disable the modules here and load all your configurations.
+ The `layout` directory contains the panel configurations. Change panel settings here or load/unload widgets.
+ In `configuration` directory you can find all the configs about the key bindings, client rules, tags, starting apps and etc.
+ The `module` consists of many files that are usually inside the `rc.lua` like notifications, app menus, etc. You can load them in the `rc.lua`.
+ The `themes` folder contains themes and colors of the setup.
+ The `widgets` contains all the widgets(of course). These are used in the panels and dashboard. It contains thenotification center, side panel(including music, calculator, weather, brightness, and volume widgets) widgets and many more.

# Where to edit this and that?
+ Colorschemes?
  - `awesome/theme`
  - Just play with `default-theme.lua` and `SETUPNAME-theme\init.lua`
+ Panels and bars?
  - `awesome/layout`
+ Client behaviour?
  - `awesome/module/decorate-client.lua`
+ Start-up Applications?

+ Keybindings?
  - `awesome/configuration/keys/`
+ Client rules?
  - `awesome/configuration/client/keys.lua`
+ Compositor?

# NOTE
+ This setup will not mostly work out of the box because:
  - YOU'RE NOT USING AWESOME-GIT-MASTER version
  - Some dependencies are not currently installed
+ Check keybindings using `Super +  F1`

# ABOUT WIDGETS AND MODULES
+ You can disable the dialog backdrop effect in `awesome/configuration/client/rules.lua`. Just search for `dialog` and set `drawBackdrop` to false in the properties. You can also just unload the module in `rc.lua`.
